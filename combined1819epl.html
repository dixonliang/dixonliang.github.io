<p> <b> Conclusion: </b> With the total goal contribution on the x-axis and percentage of contribution y-axis, we can also see <br>
which players outperformed relative to their team. Some of the top players remain up there, but now see some of the players that we
<br>  pointed out in the last slide elevated higher. With consideration of the previous charts and now this one, we can put the players in certain tiers.
<br>
<br>
Tier 1: Eden Hazard
<br>
Tier 2: Jamie Vardy, Callum Wilson, Pierre-Emerick Aubamayang, Sergio Aguero
<br>
Tier 3: Rondon, Mohamed Salah, Raheem Sterling, Harry Kane, Leroy Sane, Raul Jimenez
<br>
<br>
There are also several players that could be in the argument of deserving more playing time. These players include Fernando Llorente, Olivier Giroud, <br>
Leroy Sane, Javier Hernandez, Xherden Shaqiri, and Michy Batshuayi. There are certain reasons why these players did not get more time, but <br> perhaps could be better
contributors elsewhere especially the ones who play for top teams.
<br>
<br>
In terms of the surprising findings, Alexander-Arnold as a defender playing is one of the efficient assisters is quite remarkable. Callum Wilson and Ryan Fraser
<br>
should have been top targets (bargain ones as well) for top teams looking to boost their attacking options. Unfortunately, Glenn Murray is 36 and is at <br>
the end of his career. Rondon moved to Dalian Yifang in China following this season.
