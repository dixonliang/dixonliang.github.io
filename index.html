  // Eden Hazard annotation

  <tspan dy="15" x="610">  He was prolific for Chelsea who finished 3rd on the season.
  </tspan>
  <tspan dy="15" x="610">  He was part of 31 goals, which was nearly half of all of the
  </tspan>
  <tspan dy="15" x="610">  team's total and the most of any player in the league.
  </tspan></text>

  // Leroy Sane annotation
<text x="610" y="195" font-size="smaller"> It can be argued that Sane should have been
  <tspan dy="15" x="610">  given more playing time. He managed a 20 goals
  </tspan>
  <tspan dy="15" x="610">   contribution overall, but only appeared in 31 total games.
  </tspan>
  <tspan dy="15" x="610"> On this basis, he is almost identical to Hazard.
  </tspan></text>

  // Mohamed Salah annotation
<text x="660" y="560" font-size="smaller">
  <tspan dy="15" x="660"> 17/18's player of the year, Salah still had
  </tspan>

  </tspan>
  <tspan dy="15" x="660"> with outright totals, being one of the three top scorers.
  </tspan></text>

  // Aubameyang and Mane annotation
<text x="640" y="700" font-size="smaller">
  <tspan dy="15" x="640"> Between the two other joint top scorers, Aubameyang
  </tspan>
  <tspan dy="15" x="640"> was considerably more efficient than Mane
  </tspan>
  <tspan dy="15" x="640"> in terms of scoring and assists. Although only scoring
  </tspan>
  <tspan dy="15" x="640"> 17 goals Kane (partly due to injuries), was also
  </tspan>
  <tspan dy="15" x="640"> quite similar to Aubameyang.
  </tspan></text>

  // Man City
<text x="590" y="400" font-size="smaller">
  <tspan dy="15" x="590"> Being the champions, it is not a surprise Man City has three
  </tspan>
  <tspan dy="15" x="590"> players in this area. Aguero was the team's top scorer overall.
  </tspan>
  <tspan dy="15" x="590"> Sterling was voted by the players as player of the year. Jesus had
  </tspan>
  <tspan dy="15" x="590"> a good season considering he often split time with Aguero.

  <tspan dy="15" x="120"> Of the effective assist players in this region, only Alexander-Arnold
  </tspan>
  <tspan dy="15" x="120"> was a main player for his team through the season.
  </tspan>
  <tspan dy="15" x="120"> Llorente and Giroud were back up type players, while

<p> <b> Summary: </b> We have players from the 2018/2019 Premier League season plotted by their goals and assists per 90 minutes. <br>
Ideally, the most efficient players in each respective element are higher for assists and to the right for goals. Only players who <br>
have played a minimum of 500 minutes are included. Through this process, we hope to discover which players were the most efficient <br>
on the season, justifying their playing time or deserving of more playing time from an attacking perspective.
<br>
<br>
One of the immediate things that is noticable is that the players at the fringes who are outperformers mostly play for the top 7 teams, <br>
which are the teams that placed for European qualification. These teams were: <br> <br>
1. Manchester City <br>
2. Liverpool <br>
3. Chelsea <br>
4. Tottenham Hotspur <br>
5. Arsenal <br>
6. Manchester United <br>
7. Wolverhampton Wanderers <br> <br>
Something we might be interested in looking at the non-top 7 teams which might show us players that are under-valued simply because of the performane of their team. <br>
The next slide will show only the 13 bottom teams.
