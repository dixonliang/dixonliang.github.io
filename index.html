<p> Hi, welcome to my page. This is currently under construction. </p>
<p> My name is Dixon Liang. I'm a trader at Citi focusing on metals with experience in macro markets.
<br> I'm also currently a student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, pursuing a masters in computer science
<br> while I work full time. My plan for this page is to display some of the things that I have been working on. Outside of
<br> financial markets, I have an interest in the application of machine learning and data analytics to sports, new technologies, and space exploration.
